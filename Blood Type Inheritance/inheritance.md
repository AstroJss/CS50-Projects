*******Study the inheritance of your blood type*******

First, watch the youtube video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfZhb6lmxjk&t=164s]. 
The video tells you how the a person inherits their blood type from their parents and how their parents inherited their blood types and so on.
The child can inherit two gene alleles (there are 3 alleles: A, B and O), one each from their parents. 'A' and 'B' are dominant
over 'O' allele and hence, if a child inherits 'AO' or 'OB', their blood type is 'A' oor 'B' respectively. 

The program shows you how this works by randomly selecting one allele from each parent (actually it depends on the gene pool, but 
more on the biology later) and generates a family tree based on the number of generations entered and shows their blood types
and how they inherited it.

Enjoy running the program:)
